## 📝 **About This Version**  
> ⚠️ **This is a UI enhancement of the original script.**  
I did not develop the core functionality—this version only improves the user interface and overall usability. All credit for the original system belongs to the [original author](#credits). My goal is to offer a more immersive and visually polished experience.

This edit is **free to use and download**.
